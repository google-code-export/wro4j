# Introduction #
Dust is a javascript templating engine designed to provide a clean separation between presentation and logic without sacrificing ease of use.
A detailed documentation and its philosophy can be found on [project home page](http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/).

## Details ##
The DustJsProcessor uses DustJs engine to transform a template into javascript. For example, the following template:
```
Hello {name}! You have {count} new messages.
```

is compiled into:
```
(function () {
    dust.register("hello", body_0);

    function body_0(chk, ctx) {
        return chk.write("Hello ").reference(ctx.get("name"), ctx, "h").write("! You have ").reference(ctx.get("count"), ctx, "h").write(" new messages.");
    }
    return body_0;
})();
```

The compiled function will register a template with a name of the compiled resource. For instance, the above compiled script resulted after processing the resource named `hello.js`. That is why,  it does make sense to use DustJsProcessor as a preprocessor.

As you can see, the processor is responsible for generating compiled templates. In order to use dustJs templates in browser, you have to do additional steps (documented in DustJs guide):

  * Include the full distribution if you want to compile templates within the browser (as in the online demo):
```
<script src="dust-full-0.3.0.min.js"></script>
```

  * To render a template, call dust.render with the template name, a context object and a callback function:
```
dust.render("hello", {name: "Fred", count: 1}, function(err, out) {
  console.log(out);
});
```

  * The code above will write the following to the console:
```
Hello Fred! You have 1 new messages.
```

## Using DustJsProcessor ##
In order to use DustJsProcessor, there are several options.

### Configure wro.properties ###
Dust js uses the following alias: `DustJs`. Add this alias to wro.properties. Example:
```
preProcessors=dustJs
```

The above configuration will instruct wro4j to use DustJsProcessor as a preprocessor for all resources of type JS.
Since the dustJs templates are not quite js files, it probably does make sense to store dustJs templates in files with a different extension (example `*.template`). In order to apply the DustJsProcessor only on resources with `*.template` extension, you can update the preProcessors configuration to:
```
preProcessors=dustJs.tempate
```
The above configuration will decorate the DustJsProcessor with [ExtensionsAwareProcessorDecorator](ExtensionsAwareProcessorDecorator.md), which will enforce the DustJsProcessor to be applied only on resources with `*.template` extension.


### Using DustJsProcessor programmatically ###
You can also use or add DustJsProcessor directly in java code.
This is an example of how processor can be used in isolation:
```
processor.process(Resource.create("hello.js"), new StringReader("Hello {name}!"), writer);
```

Another alternative of using DustJsProcessor, is to add it to [ProccessorsFactory](ProcessorsManagement.md). Example:
```
public final class DefaultProcesorsFactory
  extends SimpleProcessorsFactory {
  public DefaultProcesorsFactory() {
    addPreProcessor(new DustJsProcessor());
  }
}
```
