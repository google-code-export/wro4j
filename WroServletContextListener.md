# Introduction #
When using runtime configuration (with filter), it is possible to configure wro4j with a ServletContextListener. Besides the alternative configuration, it also has the advantage of adding WroConfiguration & WroManagerFactory objects as attributes to ServletContext. This can be useful when you want to access these objects outside of the filter (example: using a jsp tag or in a servlet).

Starting with release 1.4.6, wro4j provides a listener implementation called: `WroServletContextListener`.

# Details #

## Creating listener ##
In order to use a ServletContextListener with wro4j add the following to web.xml:

```
<listener>
    <listener-class>ro.isdc.wro.http.WroServletContextListener</listener-class>
</listener>
```

The above code declares a listener which does the following:
  * When ServletContext is initialized create the WroConfiguration and WroManagerFactory and add them as attributes to ServletContext.
  * When ServletContext is destroyed, remove all attributes created during initialization.

It is important to note that adding the same listener twice in web.xml will produce an exception which will prevent your application to start. The reason is to prevent storing the same objects twice as a ServletContext attribute.

### Listener Attributes Initialization ###
By default WroConfiguration is initialized by reading the wro.properties file from `/WEB-INF/wro.properties` location. As long as `wro.properties` file contains `managerFactoryClassName` property with a not null value, the provided WroManagerFactory will be used, otherwise a default instance will be used (the one containing a predefined set of locators and processors).

It is possible to change the initialization strategy by extending the WroServletContextListener and overriding the following methods:

### Change Attributes Initialization Strategy ###
```
public class CustomListener extends WroServletContextListener {
  protected WroConfiguration newConfiguration() {
    return //a custom WroConfiguration object
  }
  protected WroManagerFactory newManagerFactory() {
    return //a custom WroManagerFactory object
  }
}
```

Alternatively it is possible to set the configuration and manager factory through setters of listener instance:

```
//Return a custom WroConfiguration object
WroServletContextListener#setConfiguration(WroConfiguration configuration);
//Return a custom WroManagerFactory object
WroServletContextListener#setManagerFactory(WroManagerFactory managerFactory);
```

## Add WroContextFilter to web.xml ##
Creation of WroManager is tightly coupled to Context. This is the reason, why you need to add an additional filter to web.xml whose responsibility is to initialize and set the Context object to all requests.

```
  <filter>
    <filter-name>WroContextFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>ro.isdc.wro.http.WroContextFilter</filter-class>
  </filter>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>WroContextFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
```

The WroContextFilter will be available in 1.4.7 release. If you need to use it before the release is available, you can [view its source](https://github.com/alexo/wro4j/blob/1.4.x/wro4j-core/src/main/java/ro/isdc/wro/http/WroContextFilter.java) on github in latest development branch.

## Accessing Servlet Context Attributes ##
The listener responsibility is to add WroConfiguration and WroManagerFactory objects to ServletContext. Accessing these objects is possible using a class named ServletContextAttributeHelper. This class hides the details about how these attributes are stored and retrieved. Usage example:
```
 ServletContextAttributeHelper helper = new ServletContextAttributeHelper(servletContext);
 WroConfiguration config = helper.getWroConfiguration();
 WroManagerFactory managerFactory = helper.getManagerFactory();
```

Another example for accesing WroModel:
```
 ServletContextAttributeHelper helper = new ServletContextAttributeHelper(servletContext);
 WroManagerFactory managerFactory = helper.getManagerFactory();
 WroModel model = getManagerFactory().create().getModelFactory().create();
```

The above examples shows how you can access the WroConfiguration and WroManagerFactory programmatically anywhere as long as you have access to ServletContext object.

## Multiple Listener Configuration ##
By default, it is not possible to have two WroServletContextListener defined in web.xml. This is a big limitation when you want to have multiple WroFilter declarations, each having a separate model & resources or cachingStrategy and locators.

In order to overcome this limitation the following solution is possible:
  * Each new filter should have an unique identifier. The init parameter called name is used as an identifier. Example:

### Filter Configuration ###
```
  <filter>
    <filter-name>WebResourceOptimizer</filter-name>
    <filter-class>ro.isdc.wro.http.WroFilter</filter-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>name</param-name>
        <param-value>first</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </filter>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>WebResourceOptimizer</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/filter1/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>

  <filter>
    <filter-name>WebResourceOptimizer</filter-name>
    <filter-class>ro.isdc.wro.http.WroFilter</filter-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>name</param-name>
        <param-value>second</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </filter>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>WebResourceOptimizer</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/filter2/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
```

The above configuration declares two different filters, each being mapped to a different url. Notice that each filter contains an init-param with an unique value. When no init-param is declared, a it is defaulted to "default".

### ServletContextListener Configuration ###
Because servlet-api doesn't allow a kind of init-param for listeners, the only way to declare multiple WroServletContextListener is to extend this class and override the `WroServletContextListener.getListenerName()`

This is the only inconvenience, since you have to create a new class for each new listener. Example:

```
public class FirstListener extends WroServletContextListener {
  public String getListenerName() {
    return "first";
  }
}
public class SecondListener extends WroServletContextListener {
  public String getListenerName() {
    return "second";
  }
}
```

And declare these listeners in web.xml:

```
<listener>
    <listener-class>com.mycompany.listener.FirstListener</listener-class>
</listener>

<listener>
    <listener-class>com.mycompany.listener.SecondListener</listener-class>
</listener>
```

Each listener will be responsible for initializing the WroConfiguration and WroManagerFactory of the filter having the same unique name used by the listener. Thus, the FirstListener will initialize the filter having init-param with name "first", while the SecondListener will initialize the second one.

### Accessing Attributes For Specific Listener ###
Having multiple listeners, means that you have multiple attributes stored in ServletContext containing wro4j specific attributes. You cannot use the following approach for accessing attributes:

```
 ServletContextAttributeHelper helper = new ServletContextAttributeHelper(servletContext);
 WroConfiguration config = helper.getWroConfiguration();
 WroManagerFactory managerFactory = helper.getManagerFactory();
```
because it will search for attribute named "default". What about uniquely identified listener names?

It is possible to use ServletContextAttributeHelper this way:
```
 ServletContextAttributeHelper helper = new ServletContextAttributeHelper(servletContext, "first");
 WroConfiguration config = helper.getWroConfiguration();
 WroManagerFactory managerFactory = helper.getManagerFactory();
```
It contains a constructor with two arguments, second being the name of your choice.

Alternatively, you can avoid hard-coding the name if you have access to filterConfig object. Example:
```
ServletContextAttributeHelper helper = ServletContextAttributeHelper.create(filterConfig);
WroConfiguration config = helper.getWroConfiguration();
WroManagerFactory managerFactory = helper.getManagerFactory();
```
In the above case, the name will be extracted for you from init-param.

## Note ##
When using `WroServletContextListener` and you want to use a custom `WroConfiguration` or `WroManagerFactory`, you'll have to extend the `WroServletContextListener` and set those objects on the listener. The reason is that the `WroFilter` will use the object from the listener if one already present and this approach guarantees that the filter and listener works with the same object instances.
