# Introduction #
wro4j-1.4.0 is a major release, containing a lot of new features and bug fixes. When migrating from an earlier version, there is a small probability that you will have to change your existing code, that is why here you'll find more details about how to migrate to this new release.

The complete list of issues fixed for this release can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/wro4j/issues/list?can=1&q=Milestone=Release-1.4.0):

# Details #
Below are described the most notable features & improvements of the 1.4.0 release.

### wro4j Grails Plugin ###
Now wro4j provides a grails plugin, which can be used in application developed in grails. More details can be found here: [GrailsPlugin](GrailsPlugin.md)

### Create WroModel using Groovy DSL ###
Groovy is great DSL which simplifies a lot wro model configuration.
Now you can easily switch from wro.xml to wro.groovy and get the same results.

An example of how wro.groovy may look like is:
```
groups {
  g1 {
    js("http://www.jquery.com/jquery.js")
    css("/style/**.css")
  }
  g2 {
    js("/path/to/script.js")
  }
  all {
    g1()
    g2()
  }
}
```

More details can be found here: [GroovyWroModel](GroovyWroModel.md)

### Url generated by CssUrlRewritingProcessor is normalized ###
This is a small improvement which reduces the length of url's in some situations. Example:

> Original url:
```
../path/to/../asset/style.css
```

> Normalized url:
```
../path/asset/style.css
```

### Wildcard Expander Support ###
In the nutshell, this feature allow transforming the [WroModel](WroModel.md) before it is being used by processors, by detecting wildcards and replacing them with the files found by applying the wildcars on some resource.

For instance, if the wro model looks like (using groovy DSL for sake of simplicity):
```
groups {
  groupWithWildcard {
    js("/path/to/**.js");
  }
}
```
The wildcard expander will transform this group to:
```
groups {
  groupWithWildcard {
    js("/path/to/script1.js");
    js("/path/to/script2.js");
    js("/path/to/script3.js");
  }
}
```
This feature is enabled by default and it is possible to disable it if required.
This feature solve limitation of using deep wildcards `**` for css containing relative background images.

Another collateral fix is: correct reporting of JsHint & CssLint issues for resources containing wildcards, by specifying exactly the name of the offending resource.

### SmartWroModelFactory ###
This is another implementation of WroModelFactory which uses a composite pattern to reuse other 3 existing WroModelFactory implementations. It is useful to allow easily to switch between any of the following DSL for building wro model: xml, groovy, json. Read [more](SmartWroModelFactory.md) about this factory.

### Simplify maven plugin processors configuration ###
One of the complains user have had regarding maven plugin, is processors configuration. In order to use a custom list of processors, the solution was to create a **CustomStandaloneWroManagerFactory** and override the **newProcessorsFactory** method.

Starting with 1.4.0 release, you aren't force to create a custom implementation of WroManagerFactory, rather create a simple **wro.properties** file, located by default at the following location: `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wro.properties` (the location of this property file can be changed.

In order to specify the processors to be used by wro4j maven plugin, the wro.properties should look like this:
```
preProcessors=cssImport,jsMin,cssMin
postProcessors=lessCss,coffeeScript
```

You can notice that the pre processors are provided using **preProcessors** key and the value is a comma separated list of processors aliases. The same applies to post processors, the only difference is the key, which is **postProcessors** in this case.

One more thing required to enable this feature is to use the following wroManagerFactory implementation (to be configured in pom.xml plugin configuration):
```
<wroManagerFactory>ro.isdc.wro.maven.plugin.manager.factory.ConfigurableWroManagerFactory</wroManagerFactory> 
```

### Add Model Transformer Support ###
Model transformer does what it says - transforms the wro model. The transformation is performed before the model is used to locate & transform resources. One applicability of this new feature is wildcard  expander, which is one of implementations provided by default.
It is possible to have multiple model transformers. These are provided as a list and are applied one after another (just like a filter chain).
It is possible to create and plug-in a different model transformer if you have such requirement.

### Problem with background url in css after aggregation ###
This problem is valid for both: run-time & build-time solution. It can be reproduced when the aggregated css is located in a deeper location than the default one. For instance, instead of `/wro/all.css` if the location is `/wro/css/all.css`. In this case, relative background url's were computed as if these were located in `/wro/` folder.

Starting with 1.4.0 release, this bug has been fixed and now the location of the aggregated css folder doesn't matter anymore.

### Remove BOM characters by default ###
BomStripperPreProcessor has been removed and the BOM characters are stripped by default. This change has also solved a couple of issues related to characters encoding.


### Google Closure compiler extensibility ###
This feature allows the client code to easily configure google closure compiler by extending or just setting few properties of GoogleClosureCompressorProcessor. Example:
```
new GoogleClosureCompressorProcessor().setCompilerOptions(options).setCompilationLevel(compilationLevel).
```

### Configuration of pre processors for wro4j-runner ###
Previous releases of wro4j-runner allowed usage of only one pre processor at a time. Now it is possible to use more processor, by providing a comma separated list. Example:
```
java -jar wro4j-runner-1.4.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -m -c semicolonAppender,packerJs,cssMin
```

### Processors configuration in config properties file ###
Now it is very easy to configure processors to be used (for run-time solution) in **wro.properties** file, when **ConfigurableWroManagerFactory** is used. This way, you can move processors configurations from **web.xml** to **wro.properties**:

```
preProcessors=cssImport,jsMin,cssMin
postProcessors=lessCss,coffeeScript
```
This is similar to wro4j maven plugin configuration.

### Improve performance of processors depending on Rhino ###
There are several processors which rely on rhino, like: coffeeScript, lessCss, sassCss, uglifyJs, packerJs, etc. Rhino can be slow in some situations.

Starting with 1.4.0 release, the performance has been improved by tweaking Rhino, more exactly: the scope of processing is reused. This change, drastically improves the time required to use rhino based processors on a lot small files (as a pre processor), also the time required to test wro4j-extensions project, dropped by more than 40 seconds.

### Create a properties file to hold the mapping between original & renamed resource for maven plugin ###
This feature allows introducing aggressive caching technique when using wro4j-maven-plugin and [naming strategy](OutputNamingStrategy.md) feature.

The idea is simple: create a properties file, holding the mapping between original (predictable) bundle name (ex: group1.js) and the name of the file renamed using one of the fingerprint encoder strategy. This allows client code to include the right resource into the final html and use far expiring headers, thus achieving aggressive resource caching.

# Migration Guide #
When migrating from earlier release (for example 1.3.8), you should be aware of the following:

  1. BomStripperPreProcessor - was removed. This is because BOM characters are stripped by default by wro4j. No need to add this processor explicitly.
  1. When extending XmlModelFactory, the method responsible for providing model stream was changed from **getConfigResourceAsStream** to **getModelResourceAsStream**.
